The wine is anchored in fragrant citrus fruits and framed nicely with toasty oak and acidity that brings great balance, integration and length to the palate.", "125": "Record low yields in 2008 slashed production by 40%, resulting in excellent fruit quality. Fragrant, ripe orange and vanilla are naturally appealing with notes of cinnamon, oak spice and piecrust. An orchard of core citrus fruits forms the supple and satisfying palate with lively acidity and an exotic, lingering finish.", "126": "Like the Reserve Chardonnay, our Barcaglia Lane bottling receives four additional months of barrel aging on the lees resulting in broad texture and fine detail. It is sourced from a single rolling vineyard in the Russian River Valley, part of the famed Dutton Ranch. Planted for us in 1998, the site consists of 3 sloping blocks planted to three different clones. The wine is strikingly aromatic with ripened mandarin, blood orange and spiced apple fruits, shot through with honeysuckle and hazelnut spice. Voluptuously built with plenty of curves, the richly woven palate gives way to a lively citrus laced finish.", "127": "From Dutton Ranch vineyards, the 2015 Barcaglia Lane Chardonnay is a beach party in a bottle, with showers of citrus and sweet tropical blossoms, cr\u00e8me brulee, and Tahitian spice. The palate is a tsunami of tropical fruit with tons of native acidity to keep the Aloha flowing.", "128": "2014 makes it three excellent vintages in a row for our Barcaglia Lane Chardonnay, sourced from a trio of clones at this Dutton Ranch vineyard. The wine is all succulent, ripe citrus with toasty tangerine, orange zest and lemon-lime. Toasty gun-barrel oak and vanilla, together with tropical fruit skin and spice completes the package. Buttressed by a framework of native acidity the wine is gauzy in weight and texture, staying up in the palate before finishing with focus and clarity.", "129": "The nose alone takes our 2017 Barcaglia Lane Chardonnay to the highest level, with nectarine and vanilla chiffon, sterling rose and preserved lemon, mineral, and sweet oak spice. Deftly weighted with citrus and tree fruits the wine achieves balance through a ribbon of native acidity carrying on to a lengthy succulent finish.", "130": "Crafted from a combination of Oak Knoll vines and longer-hanging Carneros clusters, our 2008 Napa Valley Chardonnay is satisfyingly ripe, yet focused and fresh in the same sip. Showy stone fruit, pear, hazelnut and toasty oak spices spill from the glass. Rich-bodied, fruitful and round on the palate with vanilla and subtle minerality, the wine is threaded with lively acidity bringing length and focus to a fine finish.", "131": "Grapes for the 2015 Napa Chardonnay came in early and the wine centers around ripe Bosc pear and Fuji apple with delicious caramel custard, pie crust and hazelnut. Thickly textured and satiny smooth like Deux-Sevres butter, the richness and weight are buttressed with native acidity and subtle minerality bringing complexity and length to this delicious wine.", "132": "Golden delicious apple, honeysuckle blossom and toasty caramel spice aromas are served up generously in the 2016 Napa Chardonnay. Silky in texture with ripe tree fruit and plenty of drive the wine is athletic and complex with a tail of smoky mineral and lees character.", "133": "Neil Young's \"Cinnamon Girl\" best captures the character of our rocking 2015 Reserve Chardonnay. Ripe yet succulent D'Anjou pear, gardenia blossom, sweet mineral spice and toasty brioche aromas come singing through. Broad-shouldered, with creamy textured leesy flavors, the wine reaches great depth while maintaining precision and serious structure.", "134": "The warm, vibrant character and seductive imagery of Paul Gauguin's Tahiti are captured in our 2016 Sauvignon Blanc. Awash in ripe mango, guava and papaya and laced with tropical blossoms, vanilla and spice, the wine is lush and luxuriant, fruitful to the core, yet draped in native acidity and a fleck of salinity that frame and lengthen the canvas.", "135": "Like a sailplane this 2018 Sauvignon Blanc soars with alluring floral spice, lemon-lime zest and hints of vanilla. A leading edge of native acidity frames a camber line of ripe mango and tropical fruit that tails gracefully with succulent lime skin and subtle mineral.", "136": "Blazing tropical fruit, exotic spices and sexy ripe citrus come together in this tangerine dream. Like a beach volleyball Olympian, the wine has explosive power plus tremendous depth and range on the palate. Richness and precision are continually on point, and the wine sets up high in the mouth before stretching out in a tanned and impossibly long-legged, leesy finish. ", "137": "Chardonnay is whole cluster pressed, barrel fermented and aged sur lies with batonnage in 100% French oak for 11-15 months, undergoing 100% malolactic fermentation, then bottled unfined and unfiltered. ", "138": "Our Sonoma Chardonnay comes from some of the oldest Dutton Ranch plantings in Russian River. These vines consistently yield fruit of great complexity and intensity seldom found in other sites. Cooler temperatures toward the end of the 2008 growing season resulted in crisp, well-defined flavors and long ripening times. Ripe citrus, Tupelo honey and sweet floral notes combined with seductive oak and all-spice aromas are just the beginning. Sun-ripened citrus fruit flavors are framed with brilliant acidity giving this wine its trademark zest and tremendous length."}}
